nice to have:
navlink thingy in navbar while changing pages

can't get the trailer page with the trailer to work, have tried many times and can't figure it out.

credits to the movies, I also can't get it to work.

probably the reason for why it's not working, is probabl because this is a new framework for me and there is so many things for me to understand and learn. And clearly cannot master it within 2 weeks and it's normal for it to take time to learn, not everyone can understand and learn it so quick.
